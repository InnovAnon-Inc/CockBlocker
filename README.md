# CockBlocker
Firefox Addon to Block Dick Pics
==========
Innovations Anonymous does something for the ladies:
ad blocking meets computer vision to block novel images.

In other words, this browser extension learns what kinds of images
you don't want to see, and replaces them with images you'd rather see.

Contrasting with other ad blocking implementations,
which typically use a blacklist of known ads,
this one addresses never-before-seen "ads,"
so you never have to see them.
